      <h2>The Tech Bros</h2>
      <p>We’re two friends who grew up tinkering with tech, taking apart laptops, fixing phones, and helping family and neighbors get their gear working again. What started as a hobby became a mission — to offer honest, affordable tech repair with real care behind every job.</p>

      <p>TB_Repair is all about keeping things simple: no corporate nonsense, no overpriced diagnostics, and no surprise fees. Just clean, professional work done right the first time.</p>

      <p>Whether you’ve got a broken screen, a dead laptop, or just need help figuring out what’s wrong — we’re here for it. Thanks for supporting local business!</p>
